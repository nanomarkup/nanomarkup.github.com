# Nano Markup
Nano Markup is a minimalist markup language designed to prioritize simplicity, clarity, and efficiency. With a focus on core elements like key/value pairs and indentation, Nano Markup offers a straightforward syntax that makes document creation fast and intuitive. Ideal for scenarios where lightweight and human-readable formats are crucial, it provides an elegant way to structure data and information without unnecessary complexity. 

## Language Overview
In Nano Markup, the **Key/Value** pair is a fundamental building block of the language, forming the core of how data is represented within a document. Each section consists of one or more keys, which act as unique identifiers, and their associated values. This structure ensures clarity and precision by defining relationships and properties in an unambiguous manner.

Keys always appear on a new line and must be unique within the same scope. They cannot include spaces or special characters, ensuring simplicity and consistency. Values, assigned to these keys, are versatile and can take various forms:
- Single-line values for concise data.
- Multi-line values for descriptive or extended content.
- Lists for collections of related items.
- Empty values for placeholder-like entries.

Additionally, indentation is a crucial element of Nano Markup. It is not merely a formatting choice but an integral part of the syntax. Indentation defines the hierarchical relationships between records and organizes data into clear, logical structures. Proper use of indentation ensures the document is both human-readable and machine-parsable.

## Section
A **Section** represents a structured collection of key/value pairs. Each key/value pair within the section appears on its own line, and the entire collection is defined by consistent one-tab indentation. This indentation not only visually organizes the data but also defines the hierarchical structure of the section, making the content both easy to read and interpret.

The use of one-tab indentation is essential, as it clearly demarcates the boundaries of the section and ensures an unambiguous relationship between the key/value pairs. This approach enhances the overall readability of the document, while keeping the structure simple and efficient for representing related data within a distinct unit.
```
Ariana..
    birthday 7.8.2011
    contacts..
        email ariana@gmail.com
        mobile 123456789
```
In this example, the **Ariana** section encapsulates key/value pair such as "birthday" with the value "7.8.2011" and a **contacts** section. The **contacts** section, which is indented under **Ariana**, is an inlined section, containing its own key/value pairs. By relying on indentation to structure the data, Nano Markup maintains its focus on minimalism and efficiency, enabling the representation of complex information without unnecessary syntax.
#### Key Notes
- ".. " defines the beginning of a Section, signaling the start of a structured collection of key/value pairs.
- Each **key** and its **value** are placed on their own line, and the entire Section is indented with one tab.

## List
A List is an ordered collection of items, where each item appears on a new line and is indented with a single tab. This structure ensures that the listâ€™s contents are clear and organized.

A list is defined by placing a colon (":") after the key. The key can be omitted for an **anonymous list**. The list items follow immediately on the next line, each indented by one tab. Inline lists or inlined sections follow this same pattern.

If an item in the list is a **Section**, it is preceded by a double dot (".."). The section itself starts on the next line with an additional tab of indentation, ensuring that the hierarchy remains clear and properly structured.
```

    ..
        name James
        age 20
    ..
        name John
        age 21
```
This design provides flexibility, allowing lists to contain both simple values and complex entities, all within a structured framework. The use of one-tab indentation for each list item, along with special handling for entities, ensures that data remains easy to read, organized, and adaptable to various needs.
#### Key Notes
- A colon (":") after the key indicates the start of the list.
- The key can be omitted for anonymous lists (lists without a key).
- Each item in the list is indented with one tab.
- Sections within a list are preceded by a double dot ("..") and indented with an additional tab.

## Value
A **single-line value** is a data representation placed within the current line. This provides a streamlined way to express information without requiring extra formatting.

A **multi-line value** allows for more extensive information to be captured across several lines. To define a multi-line value, the content is placed on subsequent lines, each starting with an additional tab of indentation. This approach is ideal for representing more detailed or structured data that spans multiple lines.

When defining a multi-line value for a key/value pair, any additional lines of the value are indented with one extra tab, preserving the logical structure and readability of the document.
```
name Ariana
age 12
description This is a multi-line value.
    You can add more than one line for data representation.
```
This method provides a clear, intuitive way to express complex or multi-line data, without requiring additional syntax. It maintains the hierarchical structure of the document, promoting readability and simplicity.
#### Key Notes
- A **single-line value** is written directly on the same line as the key.
- A **multi-line value** starts on the same line as the key and is continued on subsequent lines, each indented with an additional tab.
- The extra tab of indentation for multi-line values maintains the structure of the document and ensures clarity.
- **Multi-line values** are ideal for representing complex or structured data that spans more than one line.

## Comment 
A **comment** is used to add notes, explanations, or annotations to the document. Comments are ignored during parsing and are purely for human readability and documentation.

A **comment** must always begin on a new line. It cannot be placed alongside a value, key, or section. This ensures that comments remain separate from the actual data and do not interfere with the structure.

A **single-line comment** begins with the # symbol, followed by the comment text. The entire comment is confined to that line.

A **multi-line comment** starts with # on the first line, and subsequent lines are indented with one extra tab to continue the comment.
```
# This is a single-line comment. It should start from a new line.

# This is a multiline comment.
    You can describe something here.
    It spans multiple lines and provides detailed information.
```
#### Key Notes
- A **comment** must always start on a new line and cannot be added to a value, key, or section.
- A **single-line comment** begins with # and continues to the end of the line.
- A **multi-line comment** starts with # and continues on subsequent lines, each indented with one extra tab.
- Comments are ignored during parsing and are intended for human readability and documentation.
- **Multi-line comments** allow for longer explanations or detailed notes.
